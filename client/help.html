  <h3>What is IRC?</h3>
  <p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It's an old internet protocol that predates email but is still widely used today. An IRC server consists of channels(chatrooms), users, and bots. Like email, there are a wide variety of free servers and desktop clients available. Unlike email, however, there are few all-in-one services that combine a server and usable front-end client (think gmail or Yahoo mail). Jupe aims to fill that gap by offering a solid, free IRC network with an easy to use, always-on web client.</p>

  <h3>How to connect</h3>
  <p>To connect to the network first sign up. After you've signed up you'll be automatically logged into the web client and you can start chatting right away. If you'd rather use a different IRC client simply point your client to jupe.io and provide the username and password you've signed up with. If you choose to use your own client, you'll be reponsible for setting up your own persistence scheme (if that's what you're into).</p>
