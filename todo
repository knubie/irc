TOP PRIORITY:
- subscribe to all messages to remove channel loader ( or user submanager)
- secure the Methods.send method
- only ops should be able to change channel topic
- changing nick produces double users.
- investigate Latency compensation now works automatically in cases where you insert multiple documents from a method. This one's been on the roadmap for awhile. https://trello.com/c/moiiS2rP/57-pattern-for-creating-multiple-database-records-from-a-method

- change timestamp to twitter-style
- seperate say input from messages.
- make private messages change the browser window's title a la gmail chat.
- Meteor over https
- flood protection
- Send email verification
- Add /join, /part
- nicklist doesn't update (e.g. join with lingo, quit (not part))
- Add founder(+q ~), away(+a *) and bot(+b $) user modes
- fix error on sign out
- when clicking a message on 'all messages' it drops down an input to reply. clicking reply on the message does the same but prepends @nickname to the fron to fthe input
- add @ support for nicknames when using commands
- fix @ autocomplete:
  - type @mat, choose @matt, continue typing, then hit enter. it will change to @Mattykins
  - touch doesn't work for selecting nicks
