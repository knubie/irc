- kick doesn't work
- change timestamp to twitter-style
- scrollbar shows up when new messages are inserted
- seperate say input from messages.
- make private messages have blue message count badge, and change the browser window's title a la gmail chat.
- fix regexps, eg two `codes` and URLS inside of ``
- fix autocomplete, make original word last in array, address pressing tab with no matches
